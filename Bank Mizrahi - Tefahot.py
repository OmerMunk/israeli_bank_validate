def test_bank_20(account_number: str, branch_number: str) -> bool:
    """
    A function to validate a bank account and branch number based on specific rules.

    The function performs several tests on the given account number and branch number:
    - Converts the branch number to an integer.
    - If the branch number is between 401 and 799, it subtracts 400 from it.
    - Iterates over the digits of the account number and modified branch number (after the conversion and potential subtraction).
    - Performs calculations to accumulate a checksum using a multiplier.
    - Finally, the result is checked for divisibility against a set value (11), and the function returns `True` if the remainder is 0, 2, or 4.

    :param account_number: A string representing the account number. The digits are processed from right to left.
    :param branch_number: A string representing the branch number, which is converted to an integer and processed according to specific rules.

    :return: A boolean indicating whether the account and branch number pass the test (True if the test is passed, False otherwise).
