def validate_One_Zero_account(account_number: str, branch_number: str):
    '''
    This function validates the account number and branch number format.
    Length of account number should be 9 digits.
    Length of branch number should be between 1-3 digits.
    Last two digits of account number is the review_digits number.
    The formula is;
        1. Add the branch number to the beginning of the account number(1 for privet customers)
        2. Take the result and divide the modulo by 97.
        3. Subtract the result from 98, and it should be equal to the literature number.
    Note: This code checks only private customers (branch number 1)
